Search Engine Optimization:

Search engines use web crawlers to go through websites and content. The more key words that are in the webpage that are the same as the users search, the higher up on the results your webpage will be. This increases organic traffic. In general, organic searches are better than paid searches. The crawler looks at h tags, h1 is the most important. SEO algorithms evolve over time to stay ahead of the game. Tracking site analytics can help you measure KPIs, for example you will know if your leads are churning or converging to sales.

Tips to improve score:
There should only be one h1 tag.
Link to other high quality sites and have those sites link back to your site (aka backlinks)
Use analytics(google analytics/heatmaps/etc) to see what users are hovering over or clicking on to better understand your user and structure your site better.
Do not add ghost text to increase SEO it will hurt your score
Use social tags so users can share your website and boost social media engagement
Good websites should have friendly UX and easy to find information

SEO Implementation:
If these were actual trips the site is selling, I would implement google analytics and see which trip users are hovering over and not buying, and potentially have a sales. I would add social tags to the footer of the site
so it can be easily shared on twitter, facebook, etc. I would double check that the pages have only one h1 tag
and that the label is relevant to what people search. Then I'd make sure my meta data description is helpful and could possibly contain words that people are searching. I had read that google no longer uses the keywords meta data to prevent keyword stuffing.
